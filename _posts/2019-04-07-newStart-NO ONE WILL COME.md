## NO ONE WILL COME

Suddenly, something comes to my mind that I have long been out of focus. It is fairly true that I am not of even a bit regret for what I plan to do in my five-year college life. Despite that indeed it takes me a lot of time to realize that I not gona spend more time in this way. Surely I not qualified for my degree, but it is some kind of regularity that almost every Chinese college student manages to graduate from their poorly organized institution and not suitable for society jobs. I am one of them, but equipted with somethings more called self-recognition. You name it in another word *education*. Of course, I have a splendid future in front of me, but I have to stretch out for it, at least reach my arm out for it.

Long time ago, I took a lesson from Harvard call positive psychology, I forget most of it, but I know it took deep root in my mind. Still, I can recall a sentences said by the professor in the final lesson "no one will come, you have to hunt for your own happiness". The course is about psychology, and I decide to take it as kind of like a guide of my life. Some phylosophors ask for the meaning of life, where are we from and to? who are we? Those are indeed final questions about out life, but over thousands years it still remains as a myths and we can not draw to an conclusion. Leave it alone, what I get from this course at the time now I sit in front of my Mac is that I have to take responsibility to my own life and no one else will make decisions for me.

In the past years, including high school and college life, some things I did is meaningful like tennis, running, weight lifting. Although some parts in them are not perfectly performed, or even least done, the way I took is of no doubt right. Some wiser operations shall be taken in the future activities. 

So then what's next? First thing now I should do is to settle myself down, and think thoroughly. What am I going to achieve in my life and to what extent  hard life others may think can I endure in order to make it happen.

Be more realistic! Life is not so excited as you can image, those so call " peak experiences " are just miniatures of one's whole life circle, or even several people's combined experience.

So what I decide to do now is contributing all of my focusing into computer industry and all the others are just the second.

Well done, and wish you good luck! See you in three months and let's find out what you have achieved in the following days.
